## Defining and instantiating Classes

- All code must be part of a class
- static
  - When the word static is not there you must created instances of an object
  - invoked using class name
- instance:
  - invoked using instance name
- Constructor: determines how to instantiate a class
- Cant add new instance variables to instantiated objects

Arrays:
- Size must be declared when created
- Size cannot change
- More performant than lists

Maps:
- Collection of key-value pairs
-
