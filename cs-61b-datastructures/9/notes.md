### extends

- public class RotatingSLList<Item> extends SLList<Item>
- Should only be used with 'is a' relationship, not 'has a'

### super
- keword that calls the class member of the immediate parent class
- You MUST call super(); as constructors are not inherited with the rest of a class, otherwise it will come out as null
 - super() can also have a parameter
  - ex: super(x)

- All classes inheret the 'Object' class
